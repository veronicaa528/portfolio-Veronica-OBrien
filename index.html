        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Whether I’m optimizing keywords in Google & Bing, contributing ideas to magazine’s editorial team, or reporting data, I am driven by the challenge that analytics bring to the ever-so-changing world of big data. One of the most valuable tips that I have ever received about analyzing search trends is being able to research and analyze trends in the industry. After attaining my bachelor’s degree in International Business and Marketing and my MBA, I realized how important it is to be a life-long learner. Taking this coding course marries both my passions for analytics and blogging. 
            Work doesn’t just end at 5pm. Though my personal travel blog, I work to inspire others to get out of their comfort zone and just book it. Since lunching 2 years ago, I have learned so much and am excited to create my own app using what I have learned in this course. Excited to walk you through my experiences, sample work, education, skills, interests, achievements, volunteer work, and to connect as well! Hope you enjoy! </p>
